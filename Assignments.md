# Assignments

Here you will find all assignments for this course. The latest timestamp on your assignment will be considered as your final submission time.

## Redoing assignments

A lot of what we will do in this class is about trying. So, you will be allowed to redo assignments any number of times to regain 50% of the points you lost. For example, on a 10 point assignment, if you scored 7 points, and want to improve your score, you can resubmit your assignment and you may earn back 50% of the 3 points you lost, i.e., 1.5 points.

## Late submissions

If you submit a late assignment, you will automatically lose 50% of the total points and your assignment will be graded on half the original points. If you have a serious medical or family emergency, an exception will be made, and you are encouraged to contact me.
