Here you will find the syllabus for CogLab. <br>

The course is divided into two modules. In the first part of the course, we will participate in a large-scale replication effort - this will involve understanding the research design, experiment software, data collection, and data analysis. In the second part of the course, you will apply the same scientific principles to design and execute a novel replication project.
